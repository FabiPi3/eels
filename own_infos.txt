if you followed the instructions, run the parser by:

source .pyenv/bin/activate
cd nomad/dependencies/parsers/eels
python -m eelsparser tests/metadata1t.json



edit: ive changed the addValue function in /home/fabipi/nomad/dependencies/python_common/common/python/nomadcore/local_backend.py

also could use isinstance but need NoneType = type(None)

-> was changed by Markus Scheidgen



EEls.py: downloads metadata from EEls Website and stores in txt files

hyper2json.py: takes txt files and convert in json files for the parser
